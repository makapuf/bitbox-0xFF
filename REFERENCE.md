# Reference

Elements with no id are not implemented yet.

In a given position, the pixels can represent :

 - a color (transparent being color 240)
 - a number (0-255 or 0xFF, the number of the color in the palette, 0 being black and 255 white)
 - a reference to a tile : the number of the color is the number of the tile from left to right, top to bottom. note that the place of the color in the palette arranged in a 16x16 grid is the same as the position of the tile in the main area.
 - a 2D field. The pixel color is placed in X,Y position on the palette. By example, black is (0,0) and white (15,15). color 81 = 5*16+1 -> x=1,y=5

### levels 

description of the level : each id is an index on the level description bytes

level | property(0-7) | comment
----------|----------|---------
color     | 0 | color of the terrain on the minimap
player_color | 1 | color of the player on the level map
control   | 2 | see control types
accel   |  3 | X/Y (acceleration/gravity) as a 2D vector pixel. depends on controls
maxspeed   | 4  | X/Y max speed as a 2D vector pixel. depends on controls
altaccel | 5 | X/Y alt acceleration / gravity (see controls)
altmaxspeed   | 6 | running / jumping X/Y max speed as a 2D vector pixel. depends on controls
maxtime | 7 | must finish level before Nx2 seconds. If set to zero, just records it


### Control types

Player control type

control | id | description / controls / speeds & accels
-----|----|----------------------
classic   |  0  | standard controls : can (optional) run on pressing B, jump on pressing A, X fires (if available), L/R changes projectile type if several gained. AccelX=Walk, AccelY=LadderAccel, MaxSpeedX=Walk max speed, MaxSpeedY=LadderVSpeed. AltAccel_X=Run Accel, AltMaxSpeed_X=Run speed.  AltAccel_Y = gravity, AltMaxSpeed Y=fall/jump speed.
side | 100 | player can control X and Y (no gravity for player), always faces the same direction. No jumping/running. Autoscroll is given by alt speed.
modern | 249 | can double/wall jump, stomp vertically on enemies (like hitting them)
runstomp | | can charge by keeping B pressed while not moving then when ready runs, can stomp enemies forward by running (like hitting them) 
runner | | always goes right at average speed, can jump, sometimes fire
aim | | can go left+right, aims by 45 degrees increments 
hit |  | left/right ; B: run ; Y : hits enemies (horizontally or stomping) : 2 more sprites frame for hitting H/V
beatemup | | can jump on ladders, falls back where we are (default)
nojump | | cannot jump (nor run)
infjump | 255 | player has infinite jumps


### Terrains

Terrain types. ie how a terrain tile behaves.

terrain | terrain_id | description
------| -------| -----
empty | 87 | empty, does not interact with player
animated_empty | 86 | 4 frames animated but behaves like empty. TileID will be +1 % 4 each 32 frames
obstacle | 104 | blocks user from left or right  
kill | 240 | kills when touch it 
anim_kill | 168 | idem but animated
ladder | 147 | can go up, down even with gravity
ice | 151 | cannot stop on X, but can jump. 
platform | 136 | cannot fall but can go through up or sideways
jump |    | makes the player automatically jump 
animated_touch |  | animated once, transforms when user touches it

> You can also use any color defined as an enemy color.
> Remember that on tilemap, reference 255 is the level start (defaulting to top left if not found).

> TODO : make terrains testable by bits ?? by %8 ? 

### Object Types

Indices in object type definition bytes. 8 colors defined max.

 property | position | comment 
--------- | --------- | -------
 color |0| color to prepresent object on tilemap, as well as id of the top left of the first tile for the sprite frames. 230 (transparent) if this object type is undefined
 movement |1| type of movement (see object movements)
 collision |2| type of collision - sprite_collide (see object collisions table)
 spawn | 3 | type of sprite spawned when this object dies (0-15) TODO COLOR !

 alt_collision_when | | condition where alt collision is triggered See alt_collisions


### Movements

Object types movements.

### Collisions

Object collision types : what happens when an object of this type collides with the player.

col | color id | comment
------ | ------ | ------
none | 230 | no collision - respawns
kill | 240 | red (==terrain_kill) kills player instantly - respawns
killnorespawn | 237 | kills player instantly
block | 104| (=terrain obstacle) blocks the player - can push it
coin | 249 | yellow, gives a coin - or Nb =next ? , 50 of them gives a life
life | 25 | green, gives a life 
key |  137 | gives a key
end | 255| ends level 
switch | | transform next object in list into its next object (ex. if object in pos 3, objects 4 get transformed in objects 5 and reciprocally)
three_keys | | switch (next types...) only if you've got 3 keys - removes them
fire | | allows firing of projectile of type defined just after
restart | | the object dies once touched. the player will respawn here once touched.

### Alt Collisions

When is the alt collision triggered (and the standard collision by exclusion)

altcol | color_id | comment
-------|----------|-------------
none   |   230 | always standard collision
top   |   | when touches top
bottom |    | when touches bottom
side |   | when touch side
punched |  | when punched or run into
projectile |  | when a projectile touches it
punched_up |    |  when punched from bottom to top


### Projectile Type 

Projectile types are similar to object types (and are defined in the same space) but collision handling is different. 

 proj_property | position | comment 
--------- | --------- | -------
 color |0| id of the 4 frame-8x8 mini sprites tile
 movement |1| type of movement (see object movements)
 collision | | type of collision : projectiles collide only with objects. take object value
 spawn | 3 | type of sprite spawned when this object dies - or TRANSPARENT

## Black mapper 

### Black Mapper Terrain types 

Standard terrains + New terrain types defined : 
 - definitions of ALTs Id (allowing two neighbour blocks to be defined independently with the same terrain type) 
 - also decors (which will be tranformed as background tiles ), alt BG, ...

terrains must be > 64 !
